% ISO     & Isolation. When a module is power down, its output pins will be stuck in unknown state (some middle voltage). "ISO" registers will control to isolate its output pins to be a determined value, so it will not affect the status of other working modules which are not power down.\\
% NMI     & Non-maskable interrupt. \\
% REG     & Register.\\
% R/W     & Read/write. Software can read and write to these bits. \\
% RO      & Read-only. Software can only read these bits. \\
% SYSREG  & System Registers \\ %newly added
% WO      & Write-only. Software can only write to these bits.\\
